**change_summary:** initial authoring 2026-05-04 — meta pack, derived from fixtures/skill-authoring-guidelines.md (verified 2026-05-04). Captures R1–R8 quality contract for new skill source authoring.

The eight rules below are the quality contract for writing a NEW skill source from scratch. Apply BEFORE the source-to-review-YAML transform contract (`sys-skill-transform-contract`). Each rule cites the shipped failure that produced it. Treat as a checklist — if a rule cannot be satisfied, drop the example or the claim, do not paper over it.

Reviews informing these rules:

- `docs/skill-review-history/2026-04-28-batch-2-stack-foundations.md` (R1–R5)
- `docs/skill-review-history/2026-04-28-mattpocock-import.md` (R6–R8)

## R1 — Fetch authoritative docs before authoring against fast-moving APIs

For frameworks under two years old, ML/agent SDKs, and vendor SDKs (Anthropic, Prisma, OTel, mongo Node driver, mocha+tsx loaders), fetch current documentation via `ctx_fetch_and_index` BEFORE writing examples. Quote the docs when an example uses a non-trivial signature. Training-data knowledge is allowed to be six-plus months stale on these APIs and routinely is. Batch 2 shipped wrong Prisma generator name, Mongo `Decimal128` shell-vs-driver syntax, mocha `loader:` field, and OTel `resourceFromAttributes` because of stale recall. R1 is operationalized via `sys-r1-tiered-sourcing` — check the upstream registry before any web research.

## R2 — Every non-stdlib name in a code block must show its `import` once

If a block references `Prisma.Decimal`, `Decimal128`, `Anthropic.Tool`, `PrismaClientKnownRequestError`, etc., at least one block in the same skill must show the `import` line. Examples without imports compile in nobody's editor.

## R3 — Verification fragments are contracts; every item must be mechanically checkable

A verification item is a post-condition a downstream agent will check. Each item must be expressible as a one-line shell command, a single assertion, or a binary observation. Vague items ("good practices followed", "config is sensible") and unverified claims ("env-var change requires server restart" — wrong; Vite watches `.env*`) do not survive this rule. If you cannot write the check, drop the item.

## R4 — Examples must cover the case-space, not just the happy path

Two failure modes, one rule:

- **Surface coverage.** When an example claims to cover a state machine, an enum, or a method set, enumerate every case and comment why each is or is not handled. A soft-delete extension that overrides `findMany` + `findFirst` but skips `findUnique`, `count`, `update.where`, `deleteMany` leaks deleted rows — a correctness bug, not a style nit.
- **Edge trace.** Before committing any example, walk one realistic edge case through it mentally. Most batch-2 issues were happy-path examples that silently failed on the rare-but-real case (runaway tool loops, OFFSET-based pagination at scale, async assertions that race the promise).

## R5 — Date-stamp version-specific or minimum-value claims

Numeric thresholds, version requirements, and minimums change. When you write "cache prefix ≥ 4096 tokens for Opus", "INCLUDE syntax requires Postgres 11+", "`resourceFromAttributes` needs `@opentelemetry/resources` v1.27+", append `(verified YYYY-MM-DD)` inline or list it in a footer `## Verified` block. A reader six months out needs to know whether to trust the number or re-check. "I do not know — go check" beats a confident wrong number.

## R6 — Imports must label authorship honestly

If `raw_prose` is verbatim from upstream, `change_summary` says `imported verbatim from <upstream-path>`. If you authored scaffolding (rationale, examples, guardrails) around upstream prose, `change_summary` says `scaffold by skillsmith around upstream prose preserved in fragment <N>`. Never write "imported" when you authored most of the content. Batch import of mattpocock/skills shipped 4-line sources expanded to 159-line YAMLs labelled "imported" — closer to "inspired by." Readers expecting upstream voice got a different one.

## R7 — Fabricated examples must be flagged or replaced

If an example names a file path, function, domain term, or API that does not exist in any real codebase, prefix with `Illustrative — not from a real codebase:` or replace with a less specific schematic. zoom-out shipped `apps/api/src/orders/finalize.ts`, `checkout aggregate`, `payments adapter`, `order projection` as if from a known glossary. They were not. Made-up domain terms presented as canonical mislead readers, and the embedder anchors retrieval on fictional vocabulary.

## R8 — Rationale fragments need lexical anchors for the obvious query

A short rationale fragment without the keywords a real query would use is under-discriminative for `qwen3-embedding:0.6b`. Each rationale fragment must include at least three of the obvious query terms for the skill it explains. For zoom-out: "architecture", "architectural context", "system map", "module boundaries". If your rationale does not contain those words, retrieval on "how do I get higher-level architectural context?" will not surface it. Pair this rule with the fragment length floor (≥80 words) — short fragments need explicit lexical anchoring to compensate for the embedder's weakness on small inputs.

## Process for a new batch

1. Check `fixtures/upstream/registry.yaml` for each skill's vendor or language. Fetch docs per the tier (see `sys-r1-tiered-sourcing`).
2. Author the source. Apply R2, R3, R4 as you write; if importing, R6–R7.
3. Self-review verification fragments against R3 and rationale fragments against R8.
4. Dispatch an independent critic with this rules document plus the latest review history.
5. Single revision pass — line-level fixes only, resist redesigns.
6. Hand off to `sys-skill-transform-contract` for source → review YAML.

## Anti-patterns observed (do not repeat)

Running ledger; append after each batch's review.

- **Mocha tsx loader via `.mocharc.cjs` `loader:` field.** Use `--import tsx` on the script line; document `c8` for coverage. (batch 2, mocha-chai-sinon)
- **Soft-delete extension overriding only read-list methods.** Cover the full client method surface or document the gaps. (batch 2, prisma-orm-patterns)
- **Tool-loop examples without a `MAX_TURNS` cap.** Always cap. (batch 2, claude-api-patterns)
- **Mongo shell syntax in Node-driver examples.** `NumberDecimal('19.99')` is shell; the driver wants `new Decimal128('19.99')`. (batch 2, mongodb-patterns)
- **sysctl-level fixes for app-level problems.** Prefer `setcap` or a reverse proxy over `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start`. (batch 2, podman-rootless)
- **Connection pools through PgBouncer without `directUrl` for migrations.** `migrate deploy` fails through transaction-mode pooling. (batch 2, postgres-deep-patterns)
- **Over-authoring labelled as "imported".** A 4-line upstream source expanded to a 159-line YAML with the original `imported from` change_summary. (mattpocock import, grill-me, zoom-out)
- **Fabricated domain terms presented as canonical.** `payments adapter`, `checkout aggregate`, `apps/api/src/orders/finalize.ts` — invented file paths and glossary terms in a worked example. (mattpocock import, zoom-out)
- **Rationale fragment missing the obvious query keyword.** zoom-out's rationale never said "architecture" or "architectural context" — the words a real query uses. (mattpocock import, zoom-out)
