## Edge Cases

### EC-1: Existing Volume Name Conflict
- What to test:
  - Volume "agentalloy-data" already exists
  - `_create_volume()` handles duplicate volume error
- Expected: Either succeeds (volume exists) or fails gracefully

### EC-2: Existing Container Name Conflict
- What to test:
  - Container "agentalloy" already exists
  - `_run_container()` with `--replace` flag removes old container
- Expected: Old container replaced, new one starts

### EC-3: Port Already In Use
- What to test:
  - Port 47950 already in use
  - Preflight catches this
  - Error message suggests different port
- Expected: Clean failure before container run

### EC-4: Container Starts But Health Never Ready
- What to test:
  - Container runs but /health endpoint never returns 200
  - Health check times out after 300s
  - Error message includes container logs suggestion
- Expected: Clear error with troubleshooting steps

### EC-5: Container Crashes After Health Check
- What to test:
  - Container passes health check but crashes shortly after
  - State still recorded (container was healthy once)
  - User can diagnose via `agentalloy doctor`
- Expected: State recorded, error surfaced on next check

### EC-6: Auto-Clone Fails
- What to test:
  - No local build context, GitHub clone fails (network error, repo not found)
  - Error message explains how to provide build context manually
- Expected: Clear error with manual instructions

### EC-7: Partial State Recovery
- What to test:
  - Setup fails mid-flow (e.g., after build but before health check)
  - State file not corrupted
  - Next run can detect partial state and offer recovery
- Expected: State file integrity preserved

### EC-8: Multiple Deployment Modes in State
- What to test:
  - Old state has `deployment: "native"` with native fields
  - New state has `deployment: "container"` with container fields
  - `load_state()` handles both correctly
- Expected: No conflicts, correct keys used per deployment

### EC-9: Container Setup with Empty Packs
- What to test:
  - User selects no packs (empty string)
  - Container runs without AGENTALLOY_PACKS env var
  - Setup completes successfully
- Expected: Empty packs handled correctly

### EC-10: Setup Interrupted During Build
- What to test:
  - User interrupts (SIGINT) during `podman build`
  - Build process terminated
  - No partial state written
  - Can retry without error
- Expected: Clean interrupt, retryable state
