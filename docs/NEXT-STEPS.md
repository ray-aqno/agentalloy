# Next Steps — Skillsmith

**Updated:** 2026-04-28 (after batch 2 ship of 8 stack-foundation skills, commit `53a8f5e`)

Ranked by leverage. Pick one (or combine #1 + #2).

---

## 1. Improve the skill-authoring prompt (highest leverage)

The adversarial review of batch 2 captured 6 cross-skill patterns at
`docs/skill-review-history/2026-04-28-batch-2-stack-foundations.md`. Apply them to
the `sys-skill-authoring-agent` skill so future authoring is better the first time.

**Concrete additions:**

- "Before authoring a skill against any technology with API churn (frameworks <2 years old, ML/agent APIs, vendor SDKs), fetch the current authoritative docs first via `ctx_fetch_and_index`. Quote them when the example uses a non-trivial signature."
- "Every code block that uses a non-stdlib name (e.g., `Prisma.Decimal`, `Decimal128`, `Anthropic.Tool`) must show the `import` line at least once in the same skill."
- "The verification checklist is a contract. Every item must be a thing the agent can mechanically check — no vague assertions like 'good practices followed.' If you can't write a one-line shell or assertion that verifies it, drop the item."
- "For state-machine or coverage examples (soft-delete extensions, retry handlers, switch statements over enums), enumerate every method or state. Comment why each one is or isn't handled."
- "Trace through one edge case mentally before including any example. The most common failure mode is examples that work for the happy path but skip the rare-but-real edge."
- "When citing minimums or version-specific behavior (e.g., 'cache prefix must be ≥ 4096 tokens for Opus'), include the date you verified it. Quietly outdated facts are worse than 'I don't know — go check.'"

**Process:** edit the existing `sys-skill-authoring-agent` skill in
`src/skillsmith/_packs/core/` (if present) OR the `fixtures/skill-authoring-agent.md`
master prompt. Re-export, re-ingest. Run the next batch through it and compare review
feedback density.

## 2. Author the next batch — remaining audit gaps

Still missing for an agentic team. Pick 6-8 from this list:

| Topic | Pack |
|---|---|
| **GraphQL** (Apollo/urql/Yoga, N+1 mitigation, federation basics) | new `graphql` pack |
| **Webhooks** (HMAC signing, replay protection, retries, dead-letter) | new `webhooks` pack OR `engineering` |
| **Sentry / error tracking** (SDK, source-map upload, performance monitoring) | `observability` |
| **Feature flags** (GrowthBook / LaunchDarkly / Unleash, kill switches, percentage rollouts) | new `feature-flags` pack |
| **WebSocket scaling** (Redis pub/sub fan-out, auth on upgrade, reconnection backoff) | `nodejs` or new `websockets` |
| **Linear workflow** (templates, sprint planning, MRD-to-issue) | new `pm-tools` pack |
| **Slack messaging** (mrkdwn, threading, Block Kit, attachment limits) | new `pm-tools` pack |
| **Email transactional** (Resend/SendGrid/SES, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, bounce handling) | new `email` pack |
| **GitHub PR workflow** (gh CLI patterns, PR templates, auto-merge, branch protection) | `engineering` or new `github` pack |
| **Time zones** (UTC storage, conversion at edges, date-fns-tz, DST traps) | `engineering` |
| **Decimal / money** (Decimal.js / bignumber.js, currency conversion, rounding rules) | `engineering` |
| **API versioning + cursor pagination** (URL/header/content-negotiation, opaque cursors) | `engineering` |

**Run through the same flow as batch 2:** fetch docs first → author → adversarial review →
single revision → ingest → verify retrieval → push.

---

## 3. Re-author the rejected stub packs

9 skills got rejected in earlier rounds for being TOC pointers (vue-jsx-patterns,
vue-options-api-patterns, fastify-stub, etc.). The actual content lives in
`skill-source/vue/skills/skills/<parent>/reference/*.md` files which we already
imported as ~205 atomic vue skills. The stubs are now redundant.

**Action:** verify the rejection records still match reality, leave them in
`/skill-source/.../rejected/`, and move on. No re-authoring needed; the granular
ref-derived skills replaced them.

---

## 4. Deploy skillsmith to a real navistone project

End-to-end validation. Pick a real repo, run `skillsmith setup` from a fresh state,
wire it into Claude Code (or whatever IDE), and watch the agent actually use the
corpus on real tickets.

**Why this matters:** runtime feedback (which skills hit, which miss, which compose
poorly) is the only true quality signal. Authoring quality is mechanical; retrieval
quality at runtime is empirical.

**What to capture:**
- Per-query: which skills retrieved, was the result useful, did the agent's output
  look better with the skill than without?
- Failure modes: queries where the corpus has the right info but RRF didn't surface it.

This becomes the input for the next round of skill authoring + retrieval tuning.

---

## 5. Productionize the install/distribution pipeline

Operational improvements that compound across teams:

- **Pack-bump automation** — `skillsmith pack-bump <pack>` increments version,
  regenerates manifest, optionally tags a release.
- **Pack registry** — host `manifest.json` + tarballs at a stable URL so
  `skillsmith install-pack <name>` works without a local checkout.
- **Telemetry** — privacy-preserving aggregate of "which packs get queried
  most often" so authoring effort can target high-utilization gaps.
- **CI guard against drift** — `pnpm prisma validate`-style check that pack
  manifests match their YAML inventories.

Lower priority than #1 and #2 unless multiple teams are publishing packs.

---

## 6. Smaller cleanups (drift / hygiene)

- **`fragment_count` enforcement on existing packs** — a few existing pack manifests
  weren't regenerated after content changes; the validator I added catches this on
  install but the existing packs haven't been re-validated.
- **The `seed-corpus` "verified_present" path** still has the legacy 50-skill minimum
  threshold. With pack-based installs, "verified_present" doesn't make sense anymore;
  the path should be retired or rethought as "verify the loaded corpus matches the
  declared installed_packs[]".
- **`docs/CORPUS-AUDIT-2026-04-28.md`** is dated; refresh after the next batch.

---

## Recommendation

**#1 → #2 in that order.** Applying the review history to the authoring prompt is
small (one skill edit + one ingest) but compounds for every future skill. Then run the
next batch through it and watch whether the review feedback density drops.

If you want raw forward progress and don't want to revisit the meta: skip to **#2**
(next batch). If you want to validate the whole loop in production:  **#4** (deploy)
delivers the highest signal-to-noise.
