# Operator Reference

Operator guide for AgentAlloy. Covers key concepts, terminology, system architecture, configuration, and customization for operators who install, maintain, and extend their AgentAlloy instance.

## Key Concepts and Terminology

### Packs

Packs are opt-in groups of related skills, organized into tiers. Each pack contains multiple skills and a `pack.yaml` manifest declaring its tier. Packs are installed via `agentalloy install-pack <name>` or the interactive `agentalloy setup` wizard.

**Tier hierarchy** (from `skill_tier.py`):

| Tier | Purpose | Example Packs |
|------|---------|---------------|
| foundation | Core engineering practices | core, documentation, engineering, performance, refactoring |
| language | Language-specific patterns | python, typescript, go, rust, java, csharp-dotnet |
| framework | Framework-specific patterns | fastapi, react, nextjs, nestjs, vue |
| tooling | Development tools | pytest, linting, testing |
| workflow | Process and lifecycle | code-review, design-review, intake, sdd |
| domain | Domain-specific knowledge | analytics, data-engineering, ui-design |
| platform | Platform-specific | github-actions |
| protocol | Protocol conventions | rest, webhooks |
| store | Data store patterns | redis, snowflake, temporal |

**Tag policies by tier** (from `ingest.py`): Each tier has a soft ceiling on domain tags per skill and a threshold above which rationale is required:

| Tier | Soft ceiling | Rationale required above |
|------|-------------|--------------------------|
| foundation | 12 | 8 |
| language | 10 | 7 |
| framework | 10 | 7 |
| store | 10 | 7 |
| cross-cutting | 12 | 8 |
| platform | 10 | 7 |
| tooling | 8 | 6 |
| domain | 10 | 7 |
| protocol | 8 | 6 |
| workflow | 8 | 6 |

### Skills

Skills are the unit of expertise. Each skill has a `skill_id`, `canonical_name`, category, and a set of fragments. Skills are either:

- **Domain skills** — task-specific expertise (e.g., "how to write TDD tests", "how to design REST APIs"). Stored in LadybugDB as Skill nodes with Version and Fragment children. Retrieved via hybrid BM25 + dense search.
- **System skills** — governance and safety rules (e.g., "never commit secrets", "use conventional commits"). Applied via applicability predicates (`always_apply`, `phase_scope`, `category_scope`).

System skill IDs must start with `sys-`.

**Skill class** — `domain` or `system`, determines storage, retrieval, and enforcement behavior.

### Fragments

Fragments are the smallest retrievable unit of skill content. Each fragment has:

- `sequence` — ordering within the skill
- `fragment_type` — categorization (see below)
- `content` — the actual prose, verbatim from the source SKILL.md

**Fragment types** (from `ingest.py`):

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| setup | Prerequisites, configuration, environment setup |
| execution | Core task steps and instructions |
| verification | Checks, tests, confirmation criteria |
| example | Concrete illustrations or code samples |
| guardrail | Constraints, things not to do, safety rules |
| rationale | Why-explanations, not how |

**Fragment size rules** (from `ingest.py`):

- Hard minimum: 20 words (rejected below this)
- Warning minimum: 80 words (lint warning, error with `--strict`)
- Hard maximum: 2000 words (rejected above this)
- Warning maximum: 800 words (lint warning, error with `--strict`)

### Phases

Phases track where the agent is in the software development lifecycle. Valid phases (from `ingest.py`): `design`, `build`, `review`.

The SDD (Spec-Driven Development) pipeline uses additional phase markers: `spec`, `design`, `plan`, `testgen`, `build`, `verify`, `deliver`.

The phase file lives at `.agentalloy/phase` in each project. Each phase has a corresponding workflow skill whose prose is injected as the agent's persona for that phase.

**Workflow position markers** (from `ingest.py`): `sdd`, `phase:spec`, `phase:design`, `phase:plan`, `phase:testgen`, `phase:build`, `phase:verify`, `phase:deliver`, `code-review`, `release`, `incident`, `rfc`.

### Contracts

Task contracts are markdown files under `.agentalloy/contracts/<phase>/` that declare task intent. Frontmatter includes:

- `phase` — current phase
- `task_slug` — unique identifier
- `domain_tags` — BM25 input for retrieval (the primary retrieval signal)
- `scope.touches` / `scope.avoids` — file path patterns
- `success_criteria` — acceptance criteria list

When present, `domain_tags` from contracts drive BM25 retrieval — surgical and intent-aware. Without contracts, AgentAlloy falls back to rule-based keyword extraction from the task description.

### Signal Layer

The signal layer is a deterministic Python module that evaluates conditions and triggers actions. Three event types:

1. **Pre-filter** — cheap keyword matching + file-event scope checks. Decides if a signal evaluation is warranted.
2. **Gate evaluation** — deterministic predicates (`artifact_exists`, `git_state`, `contract_has_tags`) plus cosine-similarity gates against reference phrase sets.
3. **Action** — write phase file atomically, emit workflow skill prose, or fire system skills.

The signal layer runs per-request through the proxy for proxy-wired harnesses. For sidecar harnesses (Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI), the proxy path is not available and the signal layer is replaced by a file-watching sidecar. See [Sidecar Experience](sidecar-experience.md).

### Proxy interception

For proxy-wired harnesses, the AgentAlloy proxy intercepts every LLM request, evaluates the signal layer (phase transition, gate predicates, system skill applicability), mutates the request payload to inject the resulting context, and forwards to the real upstream. No per-turn hook installation is needed — the harness's LLM client points at `http://localhost:<port>/v1` via its native API-base configuration.

### Sidecar

The sidecar is a file-watching process for harnesses that can't be proxy-wired. Watches `.agentalloy/phase` and `.agentalloy/contracts/**` for changes and regenerates the harness's rules file within ~500ms (debounce). See [Sidecar Experience](sidecar-experience.md) for details.

### Classification

Harness classification determines which integration vector is available:

- **Proxy-wired** — harness honors a custom API base URL (OpenAI / Anthropic / config-file `apiBase`). Full capability: per-request context injection, gate enforcement at the proxy, automatic phase transitions. Examples: Claude Code, Continue.dev, Aider, Cline, OpenCode, Hermes Agent.
- **Sidecar** — harness routes through its own backend and cannot be intercepted. Capabilities reduced: advisory-only system skills, file-watcher phase detection. Examples: Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI.

See [Harness Catalog](install/harness-catalog.md) for the full list and [Harness Classification](harness-classification.md) for the classification spec.

### Profiles

Profiles are named bundles of skill overrides and per-profile datastores. They allow separate skill contexts for different work (e.g., `work` vs `personal`) without reinstalling.

Profile resolution order (from `profiles.py`):
1. Explicit project marker (`.agentalloy/profile`)
2. Git remote URL pattern (`match_remote` in `profiles.yaml`)
3. Path prefix (`match_path` in `profiles.yaml`)
4. Fallback to `default_profile`

See [Profiles and Overrides](profiles-and-overrides.md) for full details.

### Three-Layer Overrides

Skill overrides follow a three-layer resolution (from `customize.py`):

1. **Layer 1 (highest)** — Project-level: `.agentalloy/skills/<class>/<name>.yaml`
2. **Layer 2** — Profile-level: `~/.agentalloy/profiles/<name>/skills/<class>/<name>.yaml`
3. **Layer 3 (lowest)** — Shipped defaults: bundled in `_packs/`

Shipped defaults are immutable; operators override via project or profile layers. See [Profiles and Overrides](profiles-and-overrides.md) for CLI details.

## System Architecture Overview

### Data Plane

Two embedded databases:

| Store | Engine | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| **LadybugDB** | Kuzu (graph DB) | Skill / Version / Fragment / Pack graph — "what skill means and how its pieces relate" |
| **DuckDB** | DuckDB (columnar) | 1024-dim vector index, BM25 FTS index, composition traces, per-profile datastores (`skills.duck`), shared domain datastore (`domain.duck`) |

Embeddings are stored in DuckDB, not LadybugDB. The Kuzu VECTOR extension is intentionally NOT loaded due to lifecycle incompatibility with FastAPI.

### Service

AgentAlloy runs as a FastAPI service on port 47950 (default). Endpoints:

- `POST /compose` — hybrid retrieve + assemble (the primary entry point)
- `POST /compose/text` — same as `/compose`, returns `text/plain`
- `POST /retrieve` — retrieve only, no assembly
- `GET /retrieve/{skill_id}` — lookup single skill's fragments
- `GET /skills/{skill_id}` — inspect skill metadata
- `GET /telemetry/traces` — query composition traces
- `GET /health` — liveness probe
- `GET /diagnostics/runtime` — backend/model/DB state

### Retrieval Pipeline

1. **Query extraction** — from contract `domain_tags` (primary) or rule-based extraction from task text (fallback)
2. **BM25 leg** — lexical match over fragment content
3. **Dense leg** — cosine similarity against 1024-dim embeddings (qwen3-embedding:0.6b)
4. **RRF fusion** — phase-tuned Reciprocal Rank Fusion combines both legs
5. **Applicability filter** — deterministic predicates remove inapplicable fragments
6. **Diversity selection** — top-k with diversity constraint (default: on)
7. **Assembly** — selected fragments assembled into composed prose output

### Embedding Model

Single model for all embedding needs: `qwen3-embedding:0.6b` at 1024 dimensions. Used for:
- Fragment embeddings (retrieval)
- Semantic gate scoring (cosine similarity against reference phrase sets)
- Contract query embeddings

Backend-agnostic via OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings`. Supported backends: Ollama, LM Studio, llama-server.

### Telemetry

Every `/compose`, `/retrieve`, and signal evaluation writes a structured trace to DuckDB before the response returns. Trace fields include: `trace_id`, `request_ts`, `phase`, `task_prompt`, `status`, `selected_fragment_ids`, `source_skill_ids`, `system_skill_ids`, `workflow_skill_ids`, `retrieval_latency_ms`, `assembly_latency_ms`, `total_latency_ms`, `response_size_chars`, and (on failure) `error_code`.

Signal-layer traces additionally capture: `event_type`, `pre_filter_matched`, `gates_met`, `gates_unmet`, `qwen_calls`.

## Configuration

### Config File

User-scope configuration lives at `~/.agentalloy/config.yaml` (from `agentalloy.config`). Key settings:

- `embed_server.url` — embedding backend URL
- `embed_server.model` — embedding model name
- `embed_server.dimensions` — embedding dimensions (1024)
- `ladybug_db_path` — LadybugDB location
- `profile_name` — active profile
- `profiles_path` — profiles directory

### Profiles Config

`~/.agentalloy/profiles.yaml` — profile resolution rules:

```yaml
default_profile: default
profiles:
  work:
    match_remote: ["github.com/company"]
    match_path: ["~/work/"]
  personal:
    match_path: ["~/projects/"]
```

### Watcher Config (sidecar harnesses)

`~/.agentalloy/watch/<profile_name>.yaml` — sidecar configuration per profile. PID file: `~/.agentalloy/watch/<profile_name>.pid`. Log file: `~/.agentalloy/watch/<profile_name>.log`.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `AGENTALLOY_URL` | AgentAlloy service URL | `http://localhost:47950` |
| `LM_STUDIO_URL` | LM Studio URL | `http://localhost:1234` |
| `AGENT_MODEL` | Agent model name | `qwen/qwen2.5-coder-14b` |
| `RUNTIME_DIVERSITY_SELECTION` | Diversity mode | `on` |

## Customization

### Skill Authoring Pipeline

Skills are authored via the author-critic pipeline:

1. **Author** — Skill Authoring Agent fragments the source SKILL.md into structured YAML
2. **Dedup** — deterministic gate rejects near-duplicates (>0.92 similarity); 0.80-0.92 band passed to QA
3. **QA** — Skill QA Agent reviews against R1-R8 quality contract
4. **Ingest** — validated YAML loaded into LadybugDB via `python -m agentalloy.ingest`

Quality contract (R1-R8):
- R1: Trigger conditions clearly stated
- R2: Steps are numbered and actionable
- R3: Pitfalls section present and specific
- R4: Verification steps included
- R5: Commands are copy-paste ready
- R6: No aspirational content (all claims verified)
- R7: Cross-references to related skills are accurate
- R8: Output fits within context window constraints

See [Skill Authoring and Overrides Spec](skill-authoring-and-overrides-spec.md).

### Skill Override CLI

`agentalloy customize {list,edit,validate,update,diff,reset}` with `--profile` and `--project` flags. Edits a skill's prose, gates, or applicability without forking shipped defaults.

### Adding Packs

```bash
# List available packs
agentalloy install-packs --list

# Install a specific pack
agentalloy install-pack <name>

# Install multiple packs
agentalloy install-packs --packs pack1,pack2,pack3
```

### Re-embedding

After adding new packs or updating the embedding model:

```bash
agentalloy reembed
```

Recomputes embeddings for all unembedded or updated fragments in LadybugDB.

## Category Vocabularies

Canonical category values validated by the ingest pipeline (from `ingest.py`):

### Domain skills

`engineering`, `ops`, `review`, `design`, `tooling`, `quality`

### System skills

`governance`, `operational`, `tooling`, `safety`, `quality`, `observability`

A skill about "how to write tests" in category `ops` is a category-fit failure. Categories must describe the actual content of the skill.
