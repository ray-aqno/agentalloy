"""NXS-792: end-to-end acceptance tests for the Skill Authoring Agent flow.

Covers the full ingest-and-retrieve cycle without Ollama:
  - Bootstrap loader seeds the Skill Authoring Agent fixture
  - System review YAML loads via ingest and is retrievable via GET /skills/{id}
  - Domain review YAML loads via ingest and is retrievable via GET /skills/{id}
  - Ingested skills appear in GET /skills listing
  - Validation failures block load (spot-checked; exhaustive coverage in
    test_bootstrap.py and test_ingest.py)

Compose-via-ingested-skills requires Ollama for vector retrieval and is
covered by the golden path integration tests.
